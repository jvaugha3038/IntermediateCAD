## Teamwork

### Description
The goal of this assignment was to work with a partner to create a pull copter comprised of five parts, the top, spinner, key, ring, and prop. The top was already made for us.
My partner in this was Ryan Franck.

### Reflection
This assignment was pretty easy, as the class finished it at around the same time. This was an instruction following assignment, so the only bad part was having to flip back and forth between the instructions and the part studio.
